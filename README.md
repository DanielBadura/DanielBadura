### Hello there üëã

My name is Daniel Badura. I'm a freelance software engineer at [patchlevel](https://patchlevel.de) from Germany. I'm a full tryhard for building fast, reliable and stable software.
I'm an Event Sourcing enthusiast and one of the maintainer of [patchlevel/event-sourcing](https://github.com/patchlevel/event-sourcing). I occasionally give talks at user groups and conferences.
You can book me if you need help realizing a project or training your employees on various topics, such as event sourcing, through talks or training sessions.
